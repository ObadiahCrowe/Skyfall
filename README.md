# SkyfallSDK

Skyfall is a multithreaded Minecraft server implementation that intends to provide a far saner and comprehensive API to 
allow developers to build better, more performant, software.

It offers a clean-room approach to a Minecraft server implementation, touting version-agnostic support, allowing "legacy"
versions to be support indefinitely
